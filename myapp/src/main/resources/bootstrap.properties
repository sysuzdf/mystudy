#A Spring Cloud application operates by creating a "bootstrap" context,
#which is a parent context for the main application.
#Out of the box it is responsible for loading configuration properties from the external sources, 
#and also decrypting properties in the local external configuration files.
#any configuration retrieved during the bootstrap process will override configuration defined in local.
